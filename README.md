## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project in your local environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Git

### 2. Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_GITHUB_REPO]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Credentials (Crucial Step)**

    You need to configure your Google Cloud credentials. There are two scenarios:

    **Scenario A: Deploying on Streamlit Cloud**
    * Store all your keys (including `firebase_credentials` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) in the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file. Streamlit will automatically read them upon deployment.

    **Scenario B: Running on a Local Machine**
    * **Gemini API Key**: Keep the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your `secrets.toml` file. Streamlit can still read this locally.
    * **Service Account Key**:
        a.  Copy the entire content of the `[firebase_credentials]` section from your `secrets.toml` file and save it as a new JSON file named `service-account-key.json` in your project's root directory.
        b.  **Before running the app**, set an environment variable in your terminal that points to this file:
        ```bash
        # On macOS / Linux
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="service-account-key.json"

        # On Windows (Command Prompt)
        set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="service-account-key.json"
        ```
        *This setting is only active for the current terminal session.*

### 5. Run the Application

After completing the setup, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
The application should open automatically in your web browser.

## Future Work

* [ ] **Implement Robust Authentication**: Integrate a secure solution like `streamlit-firebase-auth` or other OAuth providers for true Google Account sign-in.
* [ ] **Architectural Refactoring**: Consider refactoring the project into a professional architecture with Next.js (Frontend) + FastAPI (Python Backend) for greater customization and scalability.
* [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provide more comprehensive error handling and user feedback for API calls and service interruptions.
* [ ] **Support for More Subjects**: Expand the AI prompt to handle essay questions from different academic fields.
